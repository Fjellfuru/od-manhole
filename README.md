# Manhole cover detection

The project manhole detection (od_manhole = object detection manhole)
shows a way to detect manhole covers from the newest swisstopo arial images.
The project contains the labeling-process, a notebook for training, some scripts to compare 
different trained models and a script for manhole cover prediction in new images.
